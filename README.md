## Requirements

Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- boto3 library (`pip install boto3`)
- AWS CLI configured with necessary permissions

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sidhu2003/PyEC2.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd pyEC2
   ```

3. Install required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

Before running the scripts, make sure to set up your AWS credentials and configure the desired settings using `aws cli`.

1. Configure AWS credentials:

   Ensure that your AWS credentials are set up either by exporting them as environment variables or by using the AWS CLI `aws configure` command.

## Usage

### Provisioning EC2 Instances

To provision EC2 instances using the configured parameters, run:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Additional Notes

- **Logging**: The scripts utilize Python's logging module to capture runtime information and errors. Logs are stored in `pyEC2.log`.

- **Error Handling**: Error handling is implemented to manage exceptions that may occur during API calls or resource provisioning.

- **Security**: Ensure that your AWS credentials are kept secure and not exposed in the source code or version control.
